        "content": "# 5 Benefits of Aromatherapy\n\nAromatherapy uses natural plant extracts (essential oils) to promote well-being. When used correctly—via diffusion, topical blends, or bath soaks—it can be a gentle, effective way to unwind and recharge.\n\n## 1) Stress Relief & Relaxation\nLavender, bergamot, and chamomile are widely studied for their calming properties. A few drops in a diffuser can help your nervous system shift from *fight-or-flight* to *rest-and-digest*.\n\n**Quick tip:** Add 4–6 drops of lavender to a diffuser during your evening wind-down routine.\n\n## 2) Better Sleep Quality\nScent can anchor bedtime rituals. Consistent use of a relaxing aroma signals your brain that it’s time to sleep.\n\n- Try a **pillow mist** with lavender or Roman chamomile.\n- Diffuse 30 minutes before lights out.\n\n## 3) Elevated Mood & Focus\nCitrus oils—like sweet orange, lemon, and grapefruit—are bright and energizing. They can help reduce grogginess and elevate motivation.\n\n**Desk blend idea:** 2 drops lemon + 2 drops peppermint in a water-based diffuser.\n\n## 4) Comfort for Tense Muscles\nWarming essential oils (ginger, black pepper) paired with soothing oils (marjoram, lavender) may ease minor, day-to-day muscle tightness when diluted in a carrier oil.\n\n> Always dilute: 1–2% for body oils (≈ 6–12 drops per 30 ml carrier).\n\n## 5) Breath Support\nEucalyptus, tea tree, and rosemary can feel relieving during seasonal changes. Inhalation steams or room diffusion are popular approaches.\n\n### Safety Notes\n- Patch test topicals; avoid eyes and mucous membranes.\n- Keep oils away from kids and pets; some are contraindicated in pregnancy or certain conditions.\n\n### Getting Started\n1. Choose one **calming** oil (lavender) and one **uplifting** oil (sweet orange).\n2. Diffuse for 20–30 minutes to learn your preference.\n3. Build a simple evening ritual around scent.",
